# Angular/Node Hackathon Project


## Summary

This was a Hackathon project at work where we had 2 days to come up with an AWS based application. I handled the front-end, which was built using the following: Node.js (to run a local server), Gulp, Bower, Bootstrap, Angular.js and Sass.

The app was meant as a file upload service.

Also note that this repo does not include any of the backend related code.
